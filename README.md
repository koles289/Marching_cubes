Project was created as a part of semestral cource of computer graphic in OpenGl. Marching cubes is an algorithm, that serves for visualization of volume data, mostly from medical visualization tools as CT or MRI.
The goal of this project was to visualize the the model of head from CT data. We used Phong model for light reflection and shading
